### This project was made for final's of (Ctrl Alt Debt)Cred-Avenvue Hackathon.
## The Problem:
- The spike in online cashless activity in recent times has lead to a large amount of people falling victim to sms frauds as most online transactions have their dependency on smsâ€™s.
- A survey showed that in 2019, 60% of SMS users received spam messages once a week, and 28% almost every day.
## Solution:
- We have developed an android application which automatically detects the phishing in incoming messages and at real time we warn the user by notification.
- User can also check the credibility of any particular message by opening it in our app with graphical representation.
- Under the hood, our API depends on an dynamic ML model which gets better with use by our users.
- User gets the warning and can also report/forward any suspicious message to 1909.
